Paynext - Fintech Research Platform

Overview
Our goal was to create a platform that allows retail investors to conduct detailed stock research with ease. We aimed to offer features such as real-time stock data, technical analysis charts, financial metrics, news, and many more features including an AI assistant. Streamlit’s intuitive and efficient framework made it an ideal choice for this project.
Key Features
Component-Based Design
Widgets and Controls: Leveraged Streamlit’s built-in widgets (sliders, dropdowns, date pickers) for interactive filtering.
Layouts: utilized st.columns and st.container for a clean, grid-based dashboard interface.
Data Visualization
Interactive Charts: Integration with Plotly for interactive candlestick and line charts.
Financial Metrics: Real-time rendering of KPIs and Pandas dataframes for deep-dive analysis.
State Management
Session State: Maintains user selection (tickers, date ranges) across reruns to ensure a seamless UX.
Tech Stack
Frontend/Backend: Streamlit (Python)
Data Source: yfinance
Visualization: Plotly, Pandas
Benefits of our Architecture
Shorter Development Times: Rapid prototyping allowed us to move from concept to code in days, not weeks.
Unified Codebase: No separation between frontend and backend reduces maintenance overhead.
Cost Effective: Simplified deployment and infrastructure management.
